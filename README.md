# XML Builder library for C++

## Note

This library is still in development so lot of things may change. There isn't any documentation becase of that reason but I plan to make some soon.

## About XML Builder Library

This library is designed to simplify the process of generating XML documents programmatically. The primary motivation behind creating this library stems from the observation that many existing XML generation tools or libraries can be overly complex, difficult to integrate, or lack flexibility for developers who need a easy-to-use solution.

### Key Motivations:
- **Simplicity**: Many existing XML generators are either too verbose or require extensive setup. This library aims to provide a straightforward and intuitive interface.
- **Header-Only Design**: The library is designed as a single header file, making it easy to integrate into projects without the need for complex build configurations or dependencies.
- **Flexibility**: Whether you're building a small script or integrating XML generation into a larger application, this library provides the tools you need.

### Why Create This Library?

The absence of a simple, lightweight, and header-only solution inspired me to create this XML builder library. My goal was to create simple library for my projects that don't need extensive setup and is ready to use with friendly interface.

## Features

- Single header file
- Use with any build system

## Limitations

- Use of modern C++ standard C++20
